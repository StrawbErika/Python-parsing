The object is a cake., objects and cakes, The logic of the cake analogy holds so far as you can have multiple instances of the objects build using the class.\n(multiple cakes, that are all made from the same recipe), just like with objects, the cakes are not necessesarily equal after creation. (somebody ate some piece of my cake, but avoided yours, so the cakes are different). , base classes, inheritance (or using a standard recipe)\nsay you want to bake a blueberry muffin. You dig into your books, and see a recipe that is written as follows:, This implies that a basic muffin recipe exists, and the author was to lazy to write all the common stuff twice., When defining classes, \"base classes\" are like that. It is the definition of the standard muffin recipe. You can make your own version by inheriting from the base class., OOP lesson 2, The cake is a lie, at least for python programming.\nWe talk about classes inheriting from objects..\nSO Question on that, So please don't try to learn \"OOP\" by learning python, as the pythonic way is .. well pythonic. , GUI, A Graphical User Interface GUI is just that. Nothing more and nothing else.\nA multitude of frameworks exists, TKinter is one of them, QT another, and Visual language is a third, where the last is a microsoft thing, and not python friendly., Tkinter is ... special I would not recommend it for people trying to learn how to create GUI's.
