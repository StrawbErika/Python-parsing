The object is a cake., objects and cakes, The logic of the cake analogy holds so far as you can have multiple instances of the objects build using the class.\n(multiple cakes, that are all made from the same recipe), just like with objects, the cakes are not necessesarily equal after creation. (somebody ate some piece of my cake, but avoided yours, so the cakes are different). , base classes, inheritance (or using a standard recipe)\nsay you want to bake a blueberry muffin. You dig into your books, and see a recipe that is written as follows:, This implies that a basic muffin recipe exists, and the author was to lazy to write all the common stuff twice., When defining classes, \"base classes\" are like that. It is the definition of the standard muffin recipe. You can make your own version by inheriting from the base class., OOP lesson 2, The cake is a lie, at least for python programming.\nWe talk about classes inheriting from objects..\nSO Question on that, So please don't try to learn \"OOP\" by learning python, as the pythonic way is .. well pythonic. , GUI, A Graphical User Interface GUI is just that. Nothing more and nothing else.\nA multitude of frameworks exists, TKinter is one of them, QT another, and Visual language is a third, where the last is a microsoft thing, and not python friendly., Tkinter is ... special I would not recommend it for people trying to learn how to create GUI's. That being said, it can be quite flexible, and is shipped with python, so it's usable in some cases, and have a right to be there.., Hay don't get mad at me, I love Tkinter, but I've learned that most people would argue in favor of my previous comment., Code specific Q and A, How do you intent to run anything?\nYou are defining a class, and a function called \"main\" but this is not \"C\", so main is never actually run..., where do you intend to start the GUI, I can only see code for modifying a GUI, by packing in some stuff..., What was the program supposed to do?\nIt sounds to me like you wan't to actually import the text in the file as python code, and run it?
