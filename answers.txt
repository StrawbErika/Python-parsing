Obviously, to compute some error or similarity most scoring functions receive an array of reference values (y_true) and an array of values predicted by your model (y_score) as main parameters, but may also receive some other parameters, specific for the metric. Scoring functions usually do not need X values., I would suggest look into the source code of the scoring functions to understand how they work., Here is a list of scoring functions in scikit-learn.', 'Upvote': '1', 'Comments': []}, {'Authors': ["'Salvador Dali'"], 'Description': "This is classifier dependent. Each classifier provides it's own scoring function., Estimator score method: Estimators have a score method providing a\n  default evaluation criterion for the problem they are designed to\n  solve.
